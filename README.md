# **South Elkhorn GIS Mapping Final**
This is a display of map options 1, 2, and 3 created by John Pike for Geo 409. My study area is the South Elkhorn Creek which is in the part of the South Elkhorn watershed in Lexington, KY. I selected this area of study because I work to collect water quality data at this site. We collect data to understand how nitrogen concentrations fluctuate on daily, monthly, and yearly timescales, and against changes in turbidity. Below are my two maps of the upstream area to the data collection point. Included in the maps are some of Lexington's flat pasture and farmland. The topography slopes from east to west, towards the stream. Any fertilizer sprayed on the farm may find its way in the stream.

Map Option 1: BaseLayer

My first map is a base-map of the area. It shows KY NAIP 2018 2ft imagery overlaid with a hill-shade layer and a circle of 1000ft radius showing the target area where I have a las dataset. The hill-shade layer was made from a DEM layer which was made from the las dataset. I chose to add contour lines to my map to visualize the flow direction of rnoff towards the stream.

Map Option 2: Digital Surface Model

My second map is a digital surface model of the area. It shows KY NAIP 2018 2ft imagery overlaid with a hill-shade layer. Highlighted in yellow to red gradient are all trees and buildings greater than 20 feet tall. You can see a cluster of tall trees in the northeast corner of the map. These trees follow the streamline of South Elkhorn Creek.
